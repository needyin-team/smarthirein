					<h6>Important Information</h6><br>
					<p><b>Security</b> You are responsible for ensuring that your log-in credentials (your username and password) are kept confidential.<br><br>SmarthireIn has implemented techSmarthireIncal and orgaSmarthireInzational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. Notwithstanding such measures, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. Moreover, one of our primary purposes is to provide you with a platform to broadcast the information in your resume and profile widely in order to maximize your career opportuSmarthireInties.

					<h6 style="color: #005eb8;"> Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Java Script</h6><br>
					<p><b>Cookies:</b> SmarthireIn uses "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online experience and time online, including for storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends.<br><br>A cookie is a text file that is either stored in your computer's memory temporarily (a "session" cookie) or placed on your hard drive (a "persistent" cookie) by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uSmarthireInquely assigned to your computer and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<br><br>When you return to the SmarthireIn site, cookies enable us to retrieve the information you previously provided, so you can easily use the features that you customized. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. For example, if you personalize SmarthireIn pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences).<br><br>We predominately use "session" cookies, which are not permanently stored on your hard drive. Session cookies expire after two hours of inactivity or when you close your browser. When you carry out a job search or apply online a large amount of data is processed by our system and transferred through each page of the search or application process. This information includes your job search criteria, data that identify your resume, covering letter, the job you are applying for, your right to work in the relevant country and the results of any questionnaire you have completed as part of the online application process as well as demographic information that is not uSmarthireInque to you. "Session" cookies allow us to keep track of this data until you have completed your search or application. We also use cookies to identify users who have been banned from using our forums for behavior that contradicts our terms of use and to track click streams, for load balancing and to enable you to navigate through the site using redirection pages.<br><br>We use "persistent" cookies primarily to ensure that we do not show you pages that you have already seen and to personalize your site experience and save you time. "Persistent" Cookies enable us to recogSmarthireInze whether you have responded to any poll or seen an advertisement or information notice placed on the site so that we do not show you the poll, advertisement or notice again the next time you visit our site. If you are a recruiter and have an alliance arrangement in place with SmarthireIn we also use "persistent" cookies to recall your alliance status and display your correct pricing information when you access our site. The "persistent" cookies we use will remain on your computer after you have left our site and will expire when you log out of the Site or 60 days after your last visit for security cookies, 90 days after your last visit for poll response and alliance cookies, or two years after your last visit for advertisement and information notice cookies. We also allow persistent third-party cookies as part of online advertising campaigns to determine and track site traffic landing from SmarthireIn’s advertising banners that have been placed on the websites of third parties. The data collected via these cookies is anonymous and the information is not linked to your personally identifiable information without your permission. The "persistent" cookies placed by our third party ad servers will remain on your computer after you have left our site for up to 20 years unless you choose to delete them.<br><br>We also allow other compaSmarthireInes to display advertisements to you while you are visiting our Sites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements from the other company servers, these compaSmarthireInes can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. SmarthireIn has no control over and is not responsible for, the practices of those third party advertisers. SmarthireIn encourages you to review the policies of such advertisers. Third parties, such as Google, Double Click, Right media and other advertiser platforms, may also use information that they gather from your activity on our Web Site to select which SmarthireIn advertisement should be displayed to you on websites other than our Web Site.<br><br>You can opt-out of customized advertising by third parties by setting your browser to decline third party cookies or some browsers allow you to block cookies from a particular third party whose customized advertising you do not wish to receive. You can also delete the advertiser's cookie each time after it has been served. In addition, third party advertisers, including advertising networks, may offer an opt-out of their customized advertising.<br><br>In addition, many of these third parties are members of the Network Advertising ISmarthireIntiative, which requires its members to provide a permanent opt-out from their customized ads. You can opt-out of customized advertising by all NAI members by visiting the NAI site. However, since opting out is enforced by serving a blocking cookie, if you later delete all cookies, you will also delete blocking cookie and will need to set it again. In addition, advertiser opt-out cookies may expire after a set period of time and will need to be reset following their expiration.<br><br>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the USmarthireInted States.
